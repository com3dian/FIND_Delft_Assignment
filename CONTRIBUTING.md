# Contributing

Thank you very much for contributing to the TODO! Below are some guidelines to ensure we can integrate new contributions effectively:

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make, preferably via an Issue, with the administrators of this repository before making a change.

In general, all contributions should be made via Pull Requests (see below).

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/WUR-AI/TODO/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

Finally, we would appreciate it if you install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for this repo so all contributors use the same pre-commit hooks. Thank you!

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a new feature branch from `develop`, called `feature/my_feature`. Implement your changes here. When you're done, create a PR with `develop`. (If `develop` has been updated in the meanwhile, merge `develop` into your feature branch `feature/my_feature` first to get the updates).
2. Before creating a PR, 1) add and/or update any tests if necessary and 2) run `pytest` locally (`pytest -v --use-mock` in CLI) to ensure compatibility with all existing tests.
3. Create a PR to merge into `develop`.
4. Please link a PR to the open issue it resolves, if relevant.
5. All PRs must be reviewed by one of the project admins before being merged. Please assign TODO to review the code.
